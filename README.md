**NOTE: Cloud technology evolves at warp speed.** Docker Compose uses more advanced features than a standard standalone image instantiation.

**PLEASE ENSURE YOU ARE USING THE LATEST DOCKER DESKTOP INSTALL. CHECK AND UPDATE BEFORE PROCEEDING**

Reported issues with these scripts (particularly on Windows) are almost always tracked down to the utilisation of an old Docker version. Even versions a few minor points old may cause issues.

TESTED ON LINUX, WINDOWS 11, and MacOS with **Docker Desktop 4.2.9 / Docker Engine v26+**
